# codealpha_basic-network-sniffer
This project is a basic network sniffer built in Python to capture and analyze network traffic. It helps beginners understand how data flows through a network and how different protocols such as Ethernet, IP, TCP, UDP, and ICMP are structured. The sniffer uses the Scapy library to capture live packets and extract useful details like source and destination IP addresses, ports, protocol type, and even previews of the packet payload. Captured traffic can also be saved in a .pcap file for further inspection using tools like Wireshark.

The project requires Python 3.8 or higher and the Scapy library, along with administrator or root privileges to run. It can be tested safely on a local machine by starting a simple HTTP server and generating traffic using curl, which allows learners to see packets related to their own requests. Through this project, one can learn how network packets are layered, gain exposure to traffic analysis, and understand the basics of how protocols interact.

This sniffer is intended for educational use only and should be run on networks you own or have explicit permission to monitor, since capturing packets without consent can be illegal. The project can be extended further by adding protocol-specific parsers for HTTP or DNS, generating traffic statistics, exporting captured data into formats like CSV, or even building a simple graphical interface to display packets in real time.
